 Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

 * tBodyAcc-XYZ
 * tGravityAcc-XYZ
 * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 * tBodyGyro-XYZ
 * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
 * tBodyAccMag
 * tGravityAccMag
 * tBodyAccJerkMag
 * tBodyGyroMag
 * tBodyGyroJerkMag
 * fBodyAcc-XYZ
 * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 * fBodyGyro-XYZ
 * fBodyAccMag
 * fBodyAccJerkMag
 * fBodyGyroMag
 * fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

 * mean: Mean value
 * std: Standard deviation
